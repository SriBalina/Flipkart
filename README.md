# Personalized Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The Personalized Product Recommendation System is designed to provide users with accurate and relevant product rankings based on their preferences and interactions. By leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and user-based collaborative filtering, the system aims to enhance user engagement, increase conversions, and deliver a personalized shopping experience.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Generates tailored product rankings for individual users.
- **Data Simulation:** Utilizes synthetic data to prototype and test the recommendation algorithm.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures accuracy using metrics such as MAE, RMSE
- **Use Case Prioritization:** Identifies and prioritizes impact scenarios for targeted outcomes.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Collects user feedback for continuous model refinement.

## Use Cases

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provide users with product suggestions tailored to their preferences.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** Increase user engagement and retention by offering relevant recommendations.
- **Cross-Selling:** Suggest complementary products to boost average order value.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously improve the system based on user feedback.
